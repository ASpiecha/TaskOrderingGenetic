# TaskOrderingGenetic
Task Ordering problem solution
- using genetic algorithm
- order crossover
- marked crossover (TBD)
- random swap mutation

Originally created to compare computations results with changing input parameters (pm, pc, generations, population size)
Reduced to single-run for readibility on Git public repository
